thue
-

My version of the esoteric Thue programming language.

To install:
sudo make install

Clean repo:
sudo make clean
or
make clean

To uninstall
sudo make uninstall

To compile WITHOUT installing:
make bin/thue

Thue grammar:
original ::= replacement
original ::= ~output
original ::= ::: - replaces original with stdin string

New grammar and language features:
# use this to comment

#!/usr/bin/env thue - to allow the program to be ran as an executable
