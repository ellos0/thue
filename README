thue
-

My version of the esoteric Thue programming language.

To install:
make install

Clean repo:
make clean

To uninstall:
make uninstall

To compile WITHOUT installing:
make bin/thue
or
make

Thue grammar:
original ::= replacement
original ::= ~output
original ::= ::: - replaces original with stdin string

New grammar and language features:
# use this to comment

#!/usr/bin/env thue - to allow the program to be ran as an executable

How to use:

install (make install)

thue <filename> (-d | -r | -l)

You can also precursor your Thue files with something along the lines of:
#!/usr/bin/env thue

This allows you to run your files as an executable. Of course you can do this using:
./thue-program.t

These files can also be ran using the thue command.
